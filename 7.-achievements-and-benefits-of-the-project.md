7.Achievements and Benefits of the Project

At present, the project has completed the development of basic game battles and has the ability for online testing after the integration with the block chain public chain. After being tested by the WEB2.0 and WEB3.0 markets and users, our Chess of Stars WEB3.0 self-propelled chess game project will definitely become an innovative project that attracts worldwide attention and can lead the new wave of WEB3.

The following is the estimated project revenue (single condition)

1\. If the player spends 1 point game blind box opportunity per game per player in 1000 rounds per day, the project team will earn 288 USDT in 1 day of game revenue.

2\. A player plays 4 point league matches per day, with 1,000 active players per day, the project team earns 144 USDT in a 1-day match.

3\. One point league blind box NFT has 50 opportunities, selling 100 point league blind box NFTs per day, and the project team earns 990 USD per day.

4\. The total number of points in a one-day point league match is 100,000 EVIC. The project team's 1-day point revenue is 2,000 USDT.

5\. The total points of self-built points competition by the club are recorded as 1,000,000 EVIC for a day. The club agent sets a 10% handling fee for the club's points competition, and the project team earns a 1-day point profit of 50,000 USDT.

6\. By adding 100 players to the Starlight league every day, you can increase a new pledge COSD value of 9,900 USDT, and a new pledge COSD value of 297,000 USDT per month.

7\. Adding 10 club agents per week, with club agents pledging COSD governance tokens worth 10,000 USDT and COSD governance tokens worth 100,000 USDT per week.

8\. The net income of the project is 1,000,000 USD per quarter, and the total calculation power involved in the distribution of net profits from the governance token COSD is 1 billion USDT. Each COSD's calculation power can distribute a profit of 0.001 USD. If the total calculation power of the holder is 100,000 COSD, the profit distribution obtained is 100 USDT.

9\. If you buy 100,000 COSD governance tokens worth 0.01 USDT in a seed round, what should the governance token price be when the annual distribution profit of the governance token is 40% of the seed round price? What should the valuation of the WEB3.0 self-propelled chess game Chess of Stars be?
