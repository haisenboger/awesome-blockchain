**3.1 Game Tokens and Points Design**

**Fungible token 1: COSD**

**Token definition: game governance token**

**Token name: COSD**

**Token issuance chain: multi chain**

**Total token issuance: 1,000,000,000 COSD**

**Token Attributes and Functions**

1\. As a settlement token for participating in net income distribution as a game project pledge pool

&#x20;

**Analysis of Net Profit Distribution Through Token Pledge**

1\. The settlement token for pledging and distributing the net profit of the game project is: USDT

2\. The formula for pledging the net profit of game projects: current net profit=current total profit - current total costs

3\. The net profit cycle for pledge distribution game project: starting from the third natural month after the game is launched, each net profit cycle for pledge distribution game project shall not exceed three natural months.

&#x20;

**Profit Distribution Method**

1\. All pledge related sections in the Chess of Stars project are merged and calculated into the total pledge governance token pool participating in dividends.

2\. Project opening, pledge management, token collection, pledge distribution, and net profit of game projects determine the proportion of the pledged COSD token in the dividend calculation based on the duration of the game project's governance token pledge.

3\. Formula for calculating the dividends per cycle of the governance token pledge pool

(1) 1 COSD = 1 calculation power

(2) Pledge token calculation power of star league qualification, pledge token calculation power for club agents = pledge quantity \* 1

(3) Computing power calculation of governance token pledge pool

(4) Number of \[ledge governance tokens in the pledge pool \* period of current pledge governance tokens/total week of current pledge pool opening period = actual calculation power of the current pledge

(5) Total net profit/total actual calculation power = distributable profit per unit of calculation power

(6) Total actual calculation power = pledge token calculation power of star league qualification + pledge token calculation power for club agents + pledge pool token calculation power

(7) Customerâ€™s total calculation power = pledge token calculation power of customerâ€™s star league qualification + pledge token calculation power for customerâ€™s club agent + customerâ€™s pledge pool token calculation power

(8) Customerâ€™s distribution profit = distributable profit per unit of calculation power \* total customer calculation power

&#x20;
