Clubs can assign two managers to participate in the management of club operations. The league blind box NFT and EVIC points of the club account can be distributed to members to participate in various levels of competition.

**6.3 Project Risks and Challenges**

1\. Technical risk: WEB3 self-propelled chess game requires the use of block chain technology, which is still in the development stage and may have technical issues such as security, scalability, performance, etc.

2\. Market risk: WEB3 self-propelled chess game market needs to face competition from other games, as well as competition from traditional games, which may affect the number of users and profitability of the game.

3\. Legal risk: WEB3 self-propelled chess game requires compliance with local laws and regulations. If the game involves illegal activities, it may face legal risks.

4\. Financial risk: WEB3 self-propelled chess game requires the use of cryptocurrency for transactions, which may face financial risks, such as cryptocurrency price fluctuations, operational and trading risks.

5\. Userâ€™s experience risk: WEB3 self-propelled chess game requires users to possess certain block chain knowledge and skills. If the userâ€™s experience is not good, it may affect the number of users and profitability of the game.

6\. Security risk: WEB3 self-propelled chess game requires ensuring the security of users' accounts. If there are security vulnerabilities, it may lead to userâ€™s assets to been stolen or game data to been tampered with.

&#x20;

**How Can We Address the Aforementioned Issues and Challenges?**

1\. Open and transparent game rules: WEB3 self-propelled chess game adopts block chain technology, and all game rules are recorded on the block chain. It is open and transparent, and cannot be tampered with to ensure game fairness.

2\. Anti-cheating mechanism: WEB3 self-propelled chess game adopts smart contract technology, which can achieve an automated anti-cheating mechanism to ensure the fairness and security of the game.

3\. Data privacy protection: WEB3 self-propelled chess game adopts encryption technology to protect users' personal information and game data privacy, and prevent hacker attacks and leaks.

4\. Decentralized trading: WEB3 self-propelled chess game adopts a decentralized trading method, allowing its users to directly interact with other users to trade, avoiding the risks and handling fees of centralized exchanges.

5\. Community governance: WEB3 self-propelled chess game adopts the community governance mode, and its users can participate in the decision-making and management of the game to ensure the fairness and sustainability of the game.

Game economic model: adopting a game model without inflation risk to avoid goodwill and financial losses caused by traditional Gamefi to the game and its players. At the same time, the game model is suitable for the development of electronic sports competitions and breaks the traditional business model of WEB2.0 games. Through the game mechanism, players' own value is reflected and financial freedom is achieved. Through reasonable and effective brand promotion and wealth effects, users of the traditional WEB2.0 game ecosystem can be transformed into WEB3.0 game ecosystem users.
