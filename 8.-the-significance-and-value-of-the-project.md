**The Significance and Value of the Project**

&#x20;

**Innovation**

In combination with the self-propelled chess game mode with 600 million players in the world, the point game-playing method of the game mechanism, the economic model of inflation-free game project, the real-time and novel e-sports pedigree and the player mode across WEB2.0 and WEB3.0, it has become a unique and truly meaningful play-ability of WEB3.0 game.

The gameplay is diverse, with lineups, constraints, equipment, and a little bit of luck, creating infinite possibilities that can never be predicted 100%. The future rich skin system will also open up new features in game skin gameplay.

**Economic Aspect**

In addition to being fun, a game can also bring significant economic benefits to players, which is incomparable to traditional WEB2.0 games. Traditional games harvest players' money time and time again, using information and technology asymmetry to cause irreparable losses to players. In Chess of Stars, no one is a god, there are only players who use their reasonable strategies to improve their chances of victory and win the opponent's EVIC points. I believe that training in the Starlight league and earning profits in the points league will also become a daily routine for everyone in the near future. You can play against your friends or opponents on the other side of the world to earn points and improve your life. Only such games can be recognized by the world, developed for a long time, and become the metaverse in the minds of players.

**Commercial Expansion**

Chess of Stars is a WEB3.0 self-propelled electronic sports game that can be run simultaneously on multiple chains. This can serve as an ecological aid for the development of various public chains and tokens.

The gameplay method and economic system of Chess of Stars can also be extended to a single token as the currency of the game economy. You can operate on a large scale or deploy an ecosystem separately for the project.

The viewing of real-time battle games is also a characteristic of e-sports games. While conducting explosive competitions and grand prix competitions, video live streaming can also be used for event and brand promotion.

Chess of Stars can also be promoted and collaborated by setting up any currency as a new point reward in the game. At the same time, traditional commercial brand sponsorship can also be combined to increase brand exposure.
